## **📌 Project Overview**  
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to answer:  
- How did **gender, class, and age** correlate with survival rates?  
- What patterns emerge from the data using **statistical summaries and visualizations**?  

---

## **🛠 Technologies Used**  
- **Python** (Core Language)  
- **Pandas** (Data Cleaning & Analysis)  
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib** (Visualizations)  

---

## **🔍 Key Features**  
✔ **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values and outliers.  
✔ **Statistical Summaries**: Mean, median, and survival distributions.  
✔ **Visualizations**:  
  - Survival rates by **gender**, **passenger class**, and **age groups**.  
  - Heatmaps for correlation analysis.  

**Example Plot**:

## **🚀 Next Steps**  
- [ ] Expand analysis to **additional variables** (e.g., fare, embarkation port).  
- [ ] Build an **interactive dashboard** using **Dash/Streamlit**.  
- [ ] Deploy findings as a **web app** for broader accessibility.
